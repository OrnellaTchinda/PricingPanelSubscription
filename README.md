### The Pricing Panel Subscripption website is a responsive website that shows different subscription plans for an educational website.

## Tech Used: ![HTML BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=HTML5&color=23555f&style=plastic&logo=html5)  ![CSS BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=CSS3&color=285f65&style=plastic&logo=css3) 

My learning was focused on making the website responsive and to work on my CSS, especially on buttons and flex. 

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I will add space between columns and try using the grid to work on my CSS-Grid.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that a project will always need improvements and a due date is a must as in all projects. I also leaned that it is best to consult the persons with the background on what you're working on to better understand what the result should look like. In my case teachers, and kids for the colors :)
